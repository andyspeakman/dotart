as well as constantly seeking bigger and better <b>projects</b> for our artists to become involved with in a variety of other 
venues around the region.</p>

else to do this for you. We think you should concentrate on producing great art work, so <b>we create and maintain your online 
gallery</b> for you and constantly create and develop new opportunities for the promotion of your work and the progression of your career.</p>
