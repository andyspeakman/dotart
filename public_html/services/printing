<p><i>What will greatly improve the quality of a print is a good paper choice in keeping with the image. 
A high contrast black and white photograph combined with a baryta paper will maximise the tonal range, alternatively 
a watercolour reproduction will benefit from the texture of an aquarelle rag.</i></p>
