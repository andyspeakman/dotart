<li><strong>What do you need from me to create my web page?</strong></li>

<p>We will send you a set up sheet outlining all the information we need from you to organise your page. We will need 
all information, including images, to be sent digitally. If you need any help with this or any other element of the 
set up process, just let us know.</p>

<li><strong>Do I need to send the work to dot-art&trade;?</strong></li>

<p>No, if work is only for sale through the website, until it is sold it remains in the hands of the artist. 
When work sells, you will be responsible for packaging it securely and attaching the documentation we will send you. 
Then we will arrange for a courier to collect the parcel from you.</p>

<li><strong>Who pays for postage and packing?</strong></li>
<p>The customer will have the price of postage added to the price of their purchase.</p>

<li><strong>Can I sell framed work through the dot-art website?</strong></li>
<p>Framed work can only be sold through the site if it is not glazed, as our couriers cannot carry glass.</p>
