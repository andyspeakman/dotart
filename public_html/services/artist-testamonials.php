<p>"My experience so far with dot-art has been a good one. I have been a member a while now, 
and still feel it is the right thing to do. Lucy is good to work with and always manages to pick work that 
I would not normally submit, which keeps me on my toes when producing new work and helps me direct my work when producing it."</p>
