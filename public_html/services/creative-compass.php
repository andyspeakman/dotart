<h3>Free business development support for artists and creative professionals</h3>



<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to supporting artists and helping them to develop their careers, we are
delighted to be working in partnership with SAFE Productions to deliver a new program for creatives in the region.</p>

<p><b>Creative Compass is a program of FREE business development support for artists and creative professionals in Greater Merseyside</b>. 
The initiative, a partnership between SAFE Productions and dot-art Services, will provide a package of tailored and comprehensive 
training, workshops and practical support to over two hundred individuals across the region.</p>

<p>Creative Compass is a staged program, meaning we can offer support to you, whatever stage your idea or business has reached. 
<b>Stage One</b> will help you to start thinking about formalising your ideas, and what form your enterprise might take; this leads to 
<b>Stage Two and Three</b>, at the end of which you will have set up your business and be ready to start trading. <b>Stage Four</b> is for 
existing creative social enterprises which require intermediate development support, and <b>Stage Five</b> is for those who would benefit 
from an intensive growth and development package.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><b>See <a href="http://www.creativecompass.org.uk">creativecompass.org.uk</a> or call 0845 017 6660 for more details or to get involved.</b></p>
