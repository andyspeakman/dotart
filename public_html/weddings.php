<h2>wedding art fund</h2>

<p>Looking for a unique, memorable and long lasting wedding gift?</p>

<p>Why not get together with a group of friends or family to set up a <b>WEDDING ART FUND?</b></p>

<p>We set up an account for the happy couple, which guests can add to in denominations of their choice.
We will then produce a <b>voucher</b> for you to give the bride and groom which they can either use to <b>purchase</b>
any of the 6000+ artworks we have for sale online, or <b>commission</b> a bespoke piece of art (don''t worry,
we will guide them through the whole process!) which will last a lifetime.</p>

<p><b>Call 0845 0176660 or email <a href="mailto:info@dot-art.com">
