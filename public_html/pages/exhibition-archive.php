<p>Daniel Craig and Derren Brown will be among the stars in a new exhibition at the Williamson Art
Gallery opening on 8 June and managed by local arts organisation dot-art. The first solo show at
the gallery by Liverpool-based artist Stephen Collett, “20 Shades of Collett” is a collection of
portraits featuring the people who have most inspired him including the James Bond Star and
the devil-bearded illusionist. The portraits have been produced using a range of innovative
methods to reflect the characteristics of the figures portrayed. William Shakespeare has been
created with words rather than brush strokes; Derren Brown emerges from an optical illusion
and Sir Richard Branson has been painted using a credit card rather than a brush.</p>

<p>The rhythm of the natural world is a recurrent theme in Erica's work – and none more so than the sea - however her 
interest in language and pre-occupation with the misuse/morphing and subsequent lost meaning of words, escalating through 
the over-load of social media, has become an increasing focus. The artist’s recent work has revolved round these two conflicting subjects; 
Every Heartbeat Counts Every Word Matters looks to consider the ease in which we accept the trivialisation / normalisation of abusive 
words and the outpouring banal noises that overwhelm. The artist asks / demands of us to search for the submerged words - not just 
to hear but to listen.</p>

This series of recent paintings is an exploration of how landscape can reveal the past; ancient monuments, mystical burial sites, 
sacred stones and architectural forms often exist side by side with more recent and contemporary constructions. </p>

<p>Following on from our summer exhibition “A Celebration of Colour” – “Expressions of the Sea” 
brings a slightly calmer and thoughtful exhibition to the Mere Grange Gallery. Living in Merseyside we 
are surrounded by miles of beautiful coastline and yet it is something then if often overlooked in the region. 
One does not have to go far here to find secluded beaches perfect for walking, picnicking, or indeed 
painting/sculpting/photographing in the Merseyside area and beyond and many of the artists at dot-art 
have drawn their inspiration from the sea. This exhibition is aiming to show different ways that artists
 have used this as their inspiration, not just the seas close to us but also around the world.

<p>
The second Art @ The Orchard show will feature the work of two painters with very different approaches to the portrayal of the human 
figure. Susan Finch places the figure within a richly expressionistic landscape, sometimes Liverpool, sometimes an imagined setting 
which reflects the inner life of her subject. Gary Beach takes the figure in the urban environment as his subject, in an effort to 
express both the hustle and bustle of the city and the loneliness and isolation this can bring.
