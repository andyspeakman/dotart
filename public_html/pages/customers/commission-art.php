<h1 class="artist">commission art</h1>

<p class="artist">Commissioning art is a fantastic way for both individuals and businesses to purchase the perfect piece 
of work for your individual needs, tailored to your unique taste, preferences and environment. We have a large numbers of artists
 who work to commission, from painters and photographers to sculptors and mural artists. dot-art manages the entire process and ensures you
 are kept up to date with progress and developments, from selecting a suitable artist to approving sketches and designs.</p>

<p class="artist">As well as small scale art work for home and business, dot-art has also gained significant experience developing and 
delivering public and community art works and projects. This could be anything from a mural on a hoarding to a large scale, 
freestanding sculpture, and can also involve and engage with target sections of the community where required (for example 
school children or tenants groups) at the concept, development or even production stages. 
Projects of this nature can often form part of Section 106 agreements and / or contribute to Corporate Social Responsibility activities.</p>

<p class="artist">You can see examples of all types of commissioned work dot-art has produced for individuals as well as clients such as 
Liverpool ONE, Merseytravel, Alder Hey Hospital and many more, in the slideshow below:</p>
