<p class="artist">Studies have again and again proved the huge benefits that collecting and commissioning
art can have on a business. The immediate advantage is the image that well placed, quality art
 conveys not only to the stakeholders of a company, but to staff, customers, suppliers and the wider
 community. Art can have a positive impact on the workforce, inspiring and motivating them through
 the working environment. The inclusion of art and therefore the support of local artists can also
 contribute to corporate social responsibility objectives and enhance your companys reputation in the
  community.</p>
  
<h3 class="artist">what?</h3>
