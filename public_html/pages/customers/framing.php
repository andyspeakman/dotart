<p><b>dot-art offers a bespoke picture framing service at very competitive prices through our Liverpool gallery.</b></p>

<p>Working only to Fine Art Trade Guild Museum and Conservation standards means that all our work is produced to the highest quality, 
using the best materials, for lasting, secure and beautiful results. Almost all our work is entirely bespoke. 
Although we are perfectly able to handle batch production of frames, for photographic exhibitions, for example, 
but we are not a frame factory. Every frame is hand made, every mount is designed and cut to exacting individual standards
</p> 

<p>Finding the right mount and frame for a treasured picture is often the hardest part. We support our customers in their choice of suitable presentations, 
considering everything from the picture itself, through to the decor of the room in which it will hang, 
the sort of lighting it will be seen in, and, of course, the budget that can be spent. 
It is our pleasure to make quality framing achievable and affordable.</p>
