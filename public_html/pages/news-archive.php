<p><b>Have you ever thought of buying a piece of original art but you're not sure where to begin?</p>
<p>We would like to invite you to buy art with confidence during the Liverpool Art Month this May.</b></p>

<p>The Art Month is a programme of events and exhibitions across the city which runs alongside the Liverpool Art Prize. 
The Art Month provides a platform for buying a diverse range of artwork from emerging and established artists, living 
and working in the Merseyside region.  Buying opportunities include the major events, The 11th Annual Arena Auction 
and The Liverpool Art Fair and these are great places to start if you are interested in investing in a piece of art, 
or just buying something because you love it.</p>

<p><b>The 11th Annual Arena Auction</b> is a unique opportunity to buy artwork from artists across the region, whilst offering a great night out. 
Whether you know exactly what you want or are just there to take in the excitement and atmosphere on the night, one thing you can 
be guaranteed is that you’ll be entertained by Arena’s fabulous auctioneer, Paul O’Keeffe, as he introduces the artworks to the 
room in his own unique style.</p> 
 
<p>The Arena Auction takes place on <b>Friday 3rd May, at Elevator Café and Bar</b>, Parliament Street. Viewing and registration from 5pm, 
auction starts at 7pm with a free glass of bubbly for everyone who registers to bid.  
Artworks can be viewed on our website <a href="http://www.arenastudiosgallery.com">arenastudiosgallery.com</a> 
from Saturday 20th April onwards and at the venue from Monday 29th April.  
</p>

<p><b>Liverpool Art Fair</b> is a four day event which aims to showcase a wide range of affordable and original art from a plethora of 
local artists; providing a unique insight into the region's creative talent and the opportunity for everyone, from seasoned 
collector to first time art buyer, to own their own piece of the Liverpool art world. The inaugural art fair in 2012 included 
the work of over 70 artists selected from more than 200 submissions; which looks set to increase this year. With a dedicated room 
of pieces for sale under £200 and a ceiling price of £2000, there will be art for every pocket.</p>
  
<p>The second annual Liverpool Art Fair takes place from <b>24-27th May, at Camp and Furnace</b> in Liverpool's Baltic Triangle.

anyone with a story or skill to share, which will take place at Pagoda Arts, the African Elders
Association and MDI (Merseyside Dance Initiative). A selection of willing volunteers will then be

online archive of traditional skills, knowledge and expertise. Finally in the spring, the website will
be launched at a series of sharing events, at which the films produced will be screened for
participants, friends and families.</p>

<h3>Alistair J Parker Exhibition</h3>

<img src="http://www.dot-art.co.uk/artists%20work/alistair%20parker/beatles-girls_tn.jpg" title="Alistair J Parker" alt="Alistair J Parker"/>

<p>As part of the 2011 Liverpool Design Festival, dot-art is delighted to be exhibiting a selection of prints by nationally and 
internationally exhibited artist and photographer Alistair J Parker, whose striking and intriguing work is represented by galleries 
in London, Manchester and Liverpool.</p>

<p>Alistair's unique fine art style explores process and media with a particular emphasis on photography, digital process and 
experimental mixed media techniques. This results in work with a unique finish and a hauntingly contemporary appeal, increasingly 
sought after by interior designers and design professionals as well as personal buyers. The adaptability of Alistair's work is 
demonstrated by its use in wallpaper, and lifestyle accessories and inclusion in advertising and TV commercials.</p>

<p>The artist says: “My work as an artist draws heavily on my experience as a photographer, bringing together a fusion of photography, 
digital imaging and fine art. The approach taken is highly experimental and combines a range of unconventional materials and processes 
in addition to the more traditional art media. Subjects are many and varied, my current work involves the observation of people and 
urban space they occupy, together with a fascination for the rapidly decaying and disappearing urban scene, particularly the classic 
seaside resort. My current work is influenced by the crossover between street art and fine art."</p>

<p>The exhibition is open to the public from 12-6pm Monday to Friday and by appointment, at dot-art, 16 Queen Avenue, Castle Street, Liverpool, L2 4TX.</p>

<h3>Future 100 Award Success</h3>

<img src="/images/future100.jpg" title="Future 100 Logo" alt="Future 100 Logo"/>

<p>On the 18th November 2010, dot-art Director Lucy Byrne was named one of the Future 100 Award Winners for 2010.
The Future 100 celebrates the achievements of young social entrepreneurs who are running a business with a triple bottom line -  
generating a commercial income whilst also having a positive impact on the environment and the community.</p>

<p>The Future 100 Awards were first launched in 2008 to recognise and profile young entrepreneurs running businesses, 
which have a triple bottom line. The definition of a triple bottom line, is a business that addresses people, planet 
and profit. They have a strong commercial foundation as well as a significant social and environmental impact. 
The Future 100 Awards recognises the success of young entrepreneurs aged 18-35 who demonstrate entrepreneurial 
flair and innovation in progressing a responsible business venture. Our definition of responsible business, 
is one which demonstrates an equal balance between economic, environmental and social goals to achieve ultimate business success. 
The future of our world is in the hands of individuals who are committed to generating commercial and ethical returns. 
Challenging economic times can offer opportunities to question the way we operate as both a business community and a society. 
We award the ‘Future 100' young entrepreneurs who are changing the face of everyday business and improve commerce’s impact on the wider world.</p>

<h3>New Exhibition at the Mere Grange Gallery</h3>

<img src="/images/MG_sea.jpg" title="Expressions of the Sea Exhibition" alt="Expressions of the Sea Exhibition"/>

<h3>dot-art Artist Success in Photography Competition</h3>

<img src="/images/sightseeing.jpg" title="Sightseeing by Patrick Ferguson" alt="Sightseeing by Patrick Ferguson"/>

<p>dot-art artist <a href="/artist/patrick-ferguson">Patrick Ferguson</a>
has been announced as the runner up in the Travelwise Photography Competition, with the photograph above, "Sightseeing"</p>

<p>Photographers were invited to submit images of popular landmarks and visitor attractions from across the region, 
as part of a TravelWise competition. To raise awareness of greener, healthier ways of getting from A to B, entries had to 
incorporate walking, cycling or public transport - all more sustainable alternatives to the car. 
The winning photographs were on public display during TravelWise Week (20-26 September). The annual sustainable travel 
awareness week is this year focussing on leisure time - encouraging people to travel by cycle, foot, 
bus or train when going on days out across Merseyside.</p>

<p>David McNaughton, TravelWise Officer, said: "We want Merseyside residents to make the most of their leisure time 
and hope that, away from the hustle and bustle of the working week, people will take the time to consider the alternatives 
to jumping in the car at the weekend. The competition's only two criteria are that the photographs must capture both a popular 
Merseyside tourist site and sustainable travel. Whether it's a bike ride to the Dream sculpture in St Helens, 
or a morning stroll past the Gormley statues in Crosby or along New Brighton seafront, there is inspiration right across 
the region and we can't wait to see what budding local photographers produce when asked to capture the best of 
what Merseyside has to offer."</p>

<h3>Liverpool Chamber of Commerce 160th Anniversary Art Exhibition</h3>

<img src="/images/liverpool_chamber.jpg" title="Liverpool Chamber of Commerce 160th Anniversary Art Exhibition" alt="Liverpool Chamber of Commerce 160th Anniversary Art Exhibition"/>

<p>Liverpool Chamber is celebrating its anniversary year with an exhibition of Liverpool themed artwork. 
The exhibition opened at the 08 Place in Whitechapel on Thursday 15th July and runs until Friday 10th September 2010.
<a href="http://www.dot-art.co.uk/pages/gallery.php">(more details here)</a>
</p>

<p>The exhibition was suggested by the Chamber's Arts & Culture Committee and has been curated by Lucy Byrne of local arts organisation, dot-art. 
The city of Liverpool is the reason that the Chamber exists - the port and the industries that were attracted to it where what 
made the city grow. The exhibition features work by eleven local artists and focuses on diverse themes of Liverpool life from 
distinctive cityscape, maritime culture and visitor attractions to heritage and popular aspects of local life. 
Maresa Molly the Chamber's Head of Policy & Information said: </p>

<p>"We are celebrating the chamber's anniversary while also recognising that arts and culture is a key driver of our economy. 
We are keen to use this as an opportunity to bring corporate buyers, visitors and members of the public in contact with some 
of the art being produced in the city at the moment. We chose the 08 place for its footfall and reach within these sectors.
We hope this exhibition will provide commercial opportunities for the artists taking part."

<p>Exhibiting artists: Matthew Thomas, Susan Finch, Gary Beach, Alan McKernan, Michelle Burrows, Daniel John, Dan Forrest,
Joe Forrest, Joe Thompson, Richard Pryke and Jane Adams.</p>

<p>On Friday 2nd July, the Hilton Hotel Liverpool hosted the Merseyside Women of the Year Awards 2010, where dot-art Director Lucy Byrne
was delighted to be awarded the Runner Up Award in the Arts and Culture Category.</p>

<p>Organiser Jean Gadsby said: "This is the eighth year of these fabulous awards, but the first time that me and my team 
have run the event. We had 75 nominations this year, which is by far the most yet, so it was a really difficult task for the 
Judges to pick the category winners."</p>

<h3>Art @ The Orchard - Un / Familiar</h3>

<img src="/images/orchard3c.jpg" title="Art @ The Orchard - Un / Familiar" alt="Art @ The Orchard - Un / Familiar"/>

<p>A look at the work of two artists - Matthew Thomas and Andrew Collin - who take familiar objects and images, and manipulate them in various ways to create new, 
interesting and often visually confusing works of art.</p>

<p>Andrew is an experimental, semi-abstract photographer whose images deliberately
confuse 2D and 3D surfaces, to create ambiguity. He particularly tries to create original
work, often from the simplest objects and scenes. The works are produced in ongoing
series, and new series are introduced if experiments produce results of interest.</p>

<p>Matthew is a photographer who merges the “decisive moment” with concept and
montage. He says: “I use photography and digital imaging technologies to create
visceral layers that question historical and cultural concepts of time and space. Each
project often consists of multiple works, grouped around specific themes and meanings.
During research and production new areas of interest arise and lead to the next body of
work... The concrete, repetitive nature of this work frees my imagination and provides
many opportunities for a "happy accident" to influence the finished product.”</p>

<p>Exhibition runs 11th June - 20th August 2010</p>

<h3>Art @ The Orchard - People, Places, Faces</h3>

<img src="http://eventbrite-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/eventlogos/81934/figuresoncanvas.jpg" title="Art @ The Orchard - People, Places, Faces" alt="Art @ The Orchard - People, Places, Faces"/>

<p>Following on from the success of the initial exhibition by James Lavott, the 

second Art @ The Orchard show will feature the work of two painters with 

very different approaches to the portrayal of the human figure. Gary Beach 

and Susan Finch are the latest artists to be featured in this innovative 

series of exhibitions in collaboration with local arts organisation dot-art, 

showcasing the work of local artists and exposing their work to a wide 

audience, in relaxed, inviting surroundings.</p>

<p>
Liverpool artist Susan Finch takes a fresh and searching look at the 

figure in her latest collection of paintings. She explores and 

celebrates the subject in vibrant oil colour, bringing out the visceral 

essence of the person she paints. She places the figure within a 

richly expressionistic  landscape, sometimes Liverpool, sometimes an 

imagined setting which reflects the inner life of her subject. Her Beatles 

quartet of paintings use written speech, not only to tell a story, but also 

to bring  an exuberant  dynamic quality to her work.</p>

<p>Gary Beach takes the figure in the urban environment as his subject. His 

work has always been influenced by the human figure, from early interest in 

comic and fashion drawing, he now uses everyday life to capture moods and 

experiences. He says of the work: “The paintings express the hustle and 

bustle and, on a more personal level, the loneliness, isolation and 

anonymity that we feel in life. The city has become a concrete muse- a focus 

to inspire my paintings. Set amongst crowded places with anonymous people 

who pass by everyday. Painting allows me an outlet for my emotions and 

passion to be expressed.”</p>

<h3>Art @ The Orchard - James Lavott, Launch Event</h3>

<p>On Thursday 28th January, a selection of invited guests joined us to celebrate the launch of a new series of exhibitions in association with
 The Orchard Resturant, Blundell Street, Liverpool. The first show sees the work of self taught painter James Lavott 
 on show over two floors. The ground floor hosts a selection of works from his “Bar Scenes” series while the lower ground 
 floor is showcasing a variety of other work demonstrating James' diversity and talent, 
 including surrealist works drawing inspiration from Dali, as well as his latest, portrait based works, 
 inspired by a trip to Parga in North West Greece.</p>
 
<p>The Orchard is a contemporary British restaurant spread over two floors of an old spice mill on Blundell Street situated 
in Liverpool’s Baltic Triangle. The venue prides itself on it's use of only locally sourced ingredients, and now extends 
this local commitment with the development of this exciting exhibition program.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs 29th January - 24th March 2010</p>

<p>During September we raised over £600 for charity, by taking part in two very different events. On Sunday 20th September, 
we took part in the Liverpool Chamber 5K Challenge, raising over £200 for Nugent Care. On Sunday 27th September, 
we also took part in an abseil from the 50 metre Mersey Tunnel Vent building in Birkenhead, and not only survived to tell the tale, 
but team dot-art raised over £450 for Henshaws Society for the Blind!</p>

<p>Danny Hampson is dot-art's featured artist for this month. Danny says this of his work:</p>
<p>"My vision is to create work that is more than simply surface design, work with a fresh contemporary 
style that also encapsulates a feeling of history and longevity. I want my designs to have the same effect 
as the great music, art and literature of the past - to sit in the subconscious and resonate with the viewer 
now and into the future." <br>

"In a world where urban life and man-made structures continually collide with the organic shapes of nature, 
my aim is to abstract and reconstruct these elements to create an eclectic montage of work that brings harmony 
and balance into the contemporary environment."

<p>After the success of 2008's “See Art” series at Optimark, dot-art is delighted to return to the venue with an exciting 
exhibition of work by Warrington based artist James Lavott, running from July 6th 2009, throughout the summer. 
The “See Art” series is designed to encourage more people to "See Art" by local artists in an accessible and 
friendly environment. By utilising a city centre opticians, the artists involved have a fantastic platform from which 
to promote their work, while allowing people who perhaps would not visit an art gallery, engage with original art as 
part of their daily lives.</p>

<p>The Liverpool-based charity has given more than £25 million to support groundbreaking research since its foundation 
in 1948, attracting a 60-strong team of cancer experts to Merseyside from around the globe in an attempt to establish 
the causes of and treatments for the disease.
The NWCRF's chief executive, Anne Jackson, said the fundraiser would provide the region with an opportunity to 
make a unique contribution to the fight against the condition.</p>

<p>"The work which our supporters pay for makes a real difference to worldwide efforts to overcome cancer. 
As we receive no Government funding, we rely on donations to continue our work. Nearly 90 pence in every pound 
given to us goes directly to paying for this vital research. The Butterfly Ball is a chance for people to play 
their part in that process while having a truly wonderful evening."</p>

<p>The black-tie ball is being sponsored by Manchester-based Employment Law Advisory Service and supported by some of 
Merseyside's leading names in retail and art, including Boodles and Dot-Art.</p>

<p>You can find out more about this fantastic charity on their <a href="http://www.cancerresearchnorthwest.co.uk/">website</a>,

<h3>eat art #3</h3>

<p>dot-arts third Eat Art event was held on Tuesday 13th November at the recently opened Print Hotel, Stanley Street, Liverpool.
Nearly 40 guests joined us for an inspiring evening of fine art and fine food in this beautifully restored venue. 
After a welcome drink in Cyan, the private members bar at Print, we moved downstairs to the restaurant for some truly delicious food.
Between courses, local artist John Sutherst gave a fascinating insight into the development and creation of his art
and answered questions from the audience. A selection of his art was on display throughout the venue, 
and of course, all work was for sale.</p>

<p>Eat Art is a regular event held at various venues around the city, with each evening highlighting a different local artist represented by dot-art. 
Our next Eat Art event will take place in February 2008 and will feature leading realist artist, Keith Fearon.

<h3>auschwitz, echoes of sorrow</h3>
<img src="/images/auschwitz/flyer_tn.jpg"  title="auschwitz, echoes of sorrow" alt="auschwitz, echoes of sorrow"/>

<p>from january 26th to february 8th 2007, the holiday inn, lime street, liverpool, hosted a photographic
exhibition by dot-art artist, john guy, entitled, "auschwitz, echoes of sorrow".</p>
<p>sixty years on, the grim legacy of the auschwitz death camp still resonates through history.
with holocaust memorial day (january 27th) imminent, liverpool photographer john guy seeks to
document the scene of one of the world’s most hideous acts by going beyond the clichés. so often shot
solely in black and white, auschwitz echoes of sorrow features startling colour photographs mixed with
atmospheric mono pictures of the camp’s buildings, surroundings and the artefacts now preserved within it.
the vivid blues of the polish winter sky above the camp’s iconic gates contrast with the gloomy
atmosphere of sepia photographs taken deep in the complex. juxtaposing close-ups of symbols of captivity
and cruelty against wider portraits of the surrounding scenery creates an account of auschwitz that stands
out in its sincerity and depth.
