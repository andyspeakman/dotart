<h3>kier north west</h3>

<p>"dot-art were very professional in their approach right from the outset; they tracked the fit out period with us, 
listened to what we were trying to achieve and put forward some fantastic proposals...
The advice we received was very beneficial in helping us to decide on our final choices, [they have] 
a good understanding of the corporate environment and really listened to what we were trying to achieve.
I would be very happy to recommend dot-art and allow Kier to be an endorsement for the product and service"</p>

your time and effort I would not hesitate to recommend you to people in the future."</p>

<h3>sturdy print and design</h3>

<p>"Thanks to yourself and the staff at dot-art in finding a picture of a Welsh landscape for the retirement of 
Sturdy Print's Chairman, Mr Paul Sturdy. You were incredibly helpful with regards to ideas for the picture, with 
emails of various types of work by different artists, with a good array of styles and the price of each shown. 
The final choice was down to the staff, who could see print outs of the selection and could therefore decide on the 
picture they wanted Paul to receive."</p>
<p>"We have no hesitation in mentioning your company when asked if we know a good supplier of art work.
A top quality painting from a top quality company."</p>

<h3>merseyside acme</h3>

The web site and the gallery space form part of a well-structured business and a complete package
for artists. Their promotional activities are invaluable to the artists featured to raise their profile and

<h3>national museums liverpool</h3>

<p>"We are very pleased to support your plans to secure a city centre gallery in which to display and promote
the work of local artists. We have been very impressed by the energy and commitment you have shown to this
project over the last few months and by the success you have already achieved in attracting interest from
the local business community. The display in Capital of Culture’s 08 place has illustrated the diversity and
quality of work in the region. It would be very fitting, particularly as we move towards 2008,
to provide a more permanent home to showcase local talent, to encourage the local arts community,
and to provide a focus for artists to meet and share their ideas and experiences."</p>

and culture."</p>

We were delighted to spend an enjoyable evening in the company of interesting people and fascinating art. 
We gained a rare insight into the mind of an artist, while enjoying good food in a welcoming environment. 
Highly recommended."</p>
