	'<p class="artist">Sarah Nicholson is a practising Fine Artist based in Northwest England. She graduated from the University of Central Lancashire in 1997 
and since then has exhibited and sold her pastel works widely in this country. She hopes to move her work on into Europe and the USA in the near future. 
</p>

<p class="artist">Having spent three years making light installations for her BA (Hons) in Fine Art, Sarah found herself without the luxury of a studio or even a domestic 
space large enough to work. She therefore returned to paper to create a range of works inspired by her travels around the country, under the title 
"Visionary Industry", indulging herself in the aesthetic qualities of the industrial landscape without the constraints of academic theory to justify her 
pleasure. However, inevitably, the more you do something the more you think about it, and Nicholson found herself gradually discovering the theoretical 
ground behind the images, uncovering relations to the tradition of the Visionary Landscape as propounded by Samuel Palmer in the 1800s and more recently 
by artists such as Prunella Clough and David Blackburn.</p>

<p class="artist">The artist says: "My interest in the industrial landscape started in 1994 when I was inspired to visit and record Parkside Colliery in the 
final days before its demolition. The energy of the people I met there seemed to also reside in the buildings and I have found myself recognizing this energy 
in other industrial sites. The vivid pigment of the pastels, applied in raw line or mixed in layers on the paper present the industrial landscape as 
both bold and fragile, reminding us of how brief but devastating their history is in relation to the environment. These ubiquitous buildings are often 
almost invisible to us, or viewed as an eyesore, yet their impact on our lives is everywhere."
</p>

<p class="artist">In 2004, with the support of several local companies in the Halton area, Sarah visited sites for one or two days to gather sketches of the 
buildings and structures of the businesses. From these sketches she then created 20 framed pastel pictures for exhibition during July and August 2004 at the 
Catalyst Discovery Centre, the UK''s only museum of chemistry. Sarah does not use a camera as she find that it inhibits her spontaneity and mark making. 
We are all chemical creatures, our very lives are a series of chain reactions, and Sarah is keen that this element is visible in her work. The buildings that
 she depicts are full of energy, the energy of the people who work in them and whose skillful formulas make our lives easier, healthier and longer. 
Sarah sees the towers and spires of the industrial skyline as enchanting, as magical and mysterious as the processes going on within them. She hopes that her 
work might open up some other understanding of industry, some recognition beyond the reflex of rejection that many people have.</p>


<p class="artist">Currently renting studios in Crosby, just outside Liverpool, from dot-art, has enabled Sarah to start a new body of work entitled 
"Energy and Environment" which will be available exclusively via dot-art soon. Sarah''s work is represented in private, corporate and university collections.
</p>
